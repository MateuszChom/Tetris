# Tetris
Game tetris, Client version, playable without server

Project made to complete PROZE subject.

Basicaly you DON'T need both sides Client and Server for application tp work, but you wont get highscores that are saved on server + you won't be able to save any of your highscore.

Project was written by me and my old friend, there is possibility to change language on Client version.

I dont have any instruction for this program because old hardrive were destroyed.
